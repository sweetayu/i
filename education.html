            <br>After then, I went to Pulau Nyior High School till the fifth grade,

            <br>and I'm currently in the last semester, or fifth semester. 
            <br>I've included a photo of my former study space below.</p>

                <p>My secondary school is Pulau Nyior National Secondary School.
                  <br> Up to fifth grade, I attended classes here. 
                  <br>In addition to the numerous new things I learnt while here, 
                  <br>I also made a lot of fascinating and memorable memories.
                  <br> One of the most memorable experiences we had was being 
                  <br>the first group to take the SPM after the COVID-19 outbreak. 
                  <br>Despite the fact that a lot transpired during the epidemic,
                  <br> we all handled it well enough to be able to resume our studies today.</p>
